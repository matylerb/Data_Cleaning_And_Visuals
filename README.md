# Data Cleaning and Exploration Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`datacleaning.ipynb`) that demonstrates data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques on a colorectal cancer dataset.

## Files
- **datacleaning.ipynb**: The main notebook for data cleaning and exploration.
- **colorectal_cancer_dataset.csv**: The dataset used in the notebook.
- **pic1_the_data.png**, **pic2_duplicates.png**, **pic3_missingvalues.png**, **pic4_outliers.png**: Visual aids for understanding the dataset and its issues.

## Key Features
1. **Data Loading**: Reads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies and reports duplicate rows in the dataset.
3. **Missing Values Analysis**: Detects missing values and provides a summary.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Uses box plots to visualize potential outliers in key columns.
5. **Country-Specific Analysis**: Focuses on Germany to calculate average age, healthcare costs, and mortality rates by gender.
6. **Visualization**: Includes bar charts, pie charts, and seaborn plots for data visualization.
7. **Risk Factor Analysis**: Explores the distribution of risk factors like smoking history, alcohol consumption, and obesity.

## How to Use
1. Open the `datacleaning.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform data cleaning and analysis.
3. Modify the code as needed to adapt to your specific dataset or analysis requirements.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Open the notebook and start exploring the dataset.
